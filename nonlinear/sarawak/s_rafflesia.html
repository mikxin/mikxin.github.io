                You take a cab to the Gunung Gading National Park where the home of the largest flower on Earth is.
                Rafflesia is the largest flowering plant in the world.
                However, this flower is parasitic and gives out awful smell.
                It is found mostly in the rainforest in Indonesia and Malaysia.
                So, you take a photo of that flower by holding your breath.
               </p>
                <p>After visiting the National Park, your trip adviser suggests two more places for you:

                </ul>
                </p>
