                You take a cab to the Semenggoh Wildlife Centre. 
                It is the home of many wildlife as well as a center for research for wildlife rehabilitation.
                This center is especially well known as the center for studying the endangered species orang utan.
                The orang utan is found in the rainforests of Malaysian Borneo, Indonesian Borneo and North Sumatra.
