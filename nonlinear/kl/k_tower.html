                <p>KL Tower is 421-meter in height, acting as a tower for communication purposes 
                <a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuala_Lumpur_Tower">(credits)</a>.
                There will be race held annually where participants race to the top of the tower.
                You ascent the tower and again look at the scenery of Kuala Lumpur from above.
                After coming down from the tower, you saw two posters about two events for today:
                
                <ul>
                    <li><a href = "k_batik.html">Batik art exhibition</a></li>
                    <li><a href = "k_colors.html">Colors of Malaysia</a></li>
                </ul>
                
                Which one would you like to go?
