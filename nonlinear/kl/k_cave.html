                <p>Batu Caves is a limestone hill where there are Hindu shrines inside and outside the cave.
                The cave is very high up and there is a steep staircase with 272 steps that leads up to the cave.
                Hindus in Malaysia gather around the cave during the Thaipusam Festival. 
                You climb up to the cave without feeling too fatigue, your hard work at the gym pays off.
                After coming down from the cave, you saw two posters about two events for today:
                
                <ul>
                    <li><a href = "k_batik.html">Batik art exhibition</a></li>
                    <li><a href = "k_colors.html">Colors of Malaysia</a></li>
                </ul>
                
                Which one would you like to go?
