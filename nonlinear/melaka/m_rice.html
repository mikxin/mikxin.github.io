                <p>So this is Malaccan-style chicken rice balls! 
                You can find chicken rice everywhere in Malaysia but rice balls are only found in Malacca.
                After ordering a plate of chicken rice for yourself, you talked to the stall owner and he told you that the
                A'Famosa Fortress is a must-see and also, there will be a mid-autumn festival celebration here at the street tonight. 
                Would you want to go to the A'Famosa now? Or you would like to try the other food in this hawker center?
