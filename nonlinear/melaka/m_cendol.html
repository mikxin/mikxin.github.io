                <p>So this is cendol! Malaysia's weather is usually hot throughout the year so, cendol is really a great
                thirst quencher on hot afternoons.
                After ordering a cendol for yourself, you talked to the stall owner and he told you that the
                A'Famosa Fortress is a must-see and also, there will be a mid-autumn festival celebration here at the street tonight. 
                Would you want to go to the A'Famosa now? Or you would like to try the other food in this hawker center?
