                Wooden clogs used to be a kind of cheap footwear worn by Malaccans.
                Nowadays, people seldom wear these slippers but start making more beautiful wooden clogs as a form of craft.
                
                After buying a pair of the clogs, you talked to the stall owner and she told you that you must go check out the 
                A'Famosa Fortress and there will be a mid-autumn festival celebration here at the street tonight. 
                Would you want to go to the A'Famosa fortress now?
