                <p>After the plane landed, you take a 2-hour bus ride to Malacca. 
                Your first stop is the The Stadthuys aka the Red Square because of the crimson coloured old buildings there.
                It was built by the Dutch occupants in the 1600's.
                It is now one of the most famous attraction in Malacca and there are museums and shops in the Red Square.
                After that, you follow your trip planner's guide to the Jonker Street, which is just a few minutes walk from the Red Square.
                Jonker Street is located near many historical buildings and is most happening during Saturday night.
                You could find tons of delicious local food, art galleries and souvenirs there.
                Upon arriving at the Jonker Street, you see so many shops along the street and now you have to choose which one to go into:
                <ul>
                    <li><a href = "m_hawker.html">Hawker Stalls</a></li>
                    <li><a href = "m_craft.html">Craft shop</a></li>
                    <li><a href = "m_pineapple.html">Pineapple Tarts stall</a></li>
                </ul>
                </p>
