                <p>Baba-Nyonya is a community of people who are descendants of Chinese-Malay in the 15th to 16th century when 
                Chinese immigrants start coming to Malacca. Baba is how they address the male while Nyonya is the ladies.
                This community was known to be highly skillful in food and craft making.
                Beaded slippers are one of the more popular crafts.
                After buying a pair of the slippers, you talked to the stall owner and she told you that you must go check out the 
                A'Famosa Fortress and there will be a mid-autumn festival celebration here at the street tonight. 
                Would you want to go to the A'Famosa fortress now?
