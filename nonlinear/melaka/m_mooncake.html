                Although Malaysia does not have four seasons, Chinese in Malaysia celebrate Mid-Autumn Festival
                aka Mooncake Festival.
                It is celebrated on the day of full moon and there are many different versions of the origin of this festival.
                Family members usually gather at night and enjoy playing lanterns or eating mooncake.
