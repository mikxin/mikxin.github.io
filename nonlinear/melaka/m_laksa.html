                <p>So this is Laksa! Malaysians are very used to spicy food therefore 
                be sure to order a cold drink in case it gets too hot for you.
                After ordering a Laksa for yourself, you talked to the stall owner and he told you that the
                A'Famosa Fortress is a must-see and also, there will be a mid-autumn festival celebration here at the street tonight. 
                Would you want to go to the A'Famosa now? Or you would like to try the other food in this hawker center?
