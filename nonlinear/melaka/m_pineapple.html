                <p>Pineapple tarts are one of the traditional Chinese cookies that is a must-have during Chinese New Year here.
                The usual shape of pineapple tarts is in the form of sunflower: pastry layer topped with pineapple jam.
                After buying some tarts for yourself, you talked to the shop owner and she told you that you must go check out the 
                A'Famosa Fortress and there will be a mid-autumn festival celebration here at the street tonight. 
                Would you want to go to the A'Famosa fortress now?
